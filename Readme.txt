HCVDetect: AI-Powered Hepatitis C Stage Detection & Information Hub
Project Goal:

HCVDetect is a web-based platform designed to provide accessible and informative resources related to Hepatitis C (HCV). Its primary aim is to leverage Artificial Intelligence to:

Educate Users: Offer a user-friendly interface where individuals can learn about HCV, its stages, risks, and prevention.

Introduce an AI Diagnostic Concept: Showcase the potential of an AI-powered tool that could analyze blood sample parameters for early HCV stage detection (note: the landing page describes this tool; the actual diagnostic ML model integration would be a subsequent development phase).

Provide AI-Assisted Information: Offer an interactive AI assistant (HcvInfoBot) that can answer general user questions about Hepatitis C, powered by Google's Gemini API.

Enhance Engagement: Utilize dynamic, AI-generated visuals throughout the site to create a modern and engaging user experience.

Target Audience:

Individuals seeking general information about Hepatitis C.

Patients or those at risk looking for resources and understanding.

Healthcare professionals interested in AI applications in HCV diagnostics (as a conceptual tool).

Key Features & Sections (as implemented in the landing page):

Modern Hero Section:

Visual Style: Clean, professional, and tech-forward, inspired by designs like hero2.jpg. Features a two-column layout with a compelling headline ("Advanced HCV Stage Detection Powered by AI") and a clear call-to-action ("Get Started").

Imagery: Utilizes an AI-generated isometric illustration depicting medical professionals interacting with futuristic AI interfaces, reinforcing the technological aspect.

Diagnostic Tool Overview:

Concept: Describes a sophisticated (conceptual) AI tool that analyzes blood sample data to assess HCV stages.

Benefits Highlighted: Emphasizes speed, reliability, ease of use, and support for clinical decisions.

Visuals: Accompanied by AI-generated illustrations depicting the diagnostic process.

Interactive AI Assistant (HcvInfoBot):

Functionality: Allows users to ask general questions about Hepatitis C (e.g., transmission, symptoms, prevention).

Technology: Powered by Google's Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash) to generate informative responses.

User Interface: Includes a text input field, an "Ask AI âœ¨" button, and a display area for the AI's answer, along with loading and error states.

Crucial Disclaimer: Prominently displays a disclaimer that the AI provides general information for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

System Prompting: The AI is guided by a system prompt to provide factual information and to decline requests for medical advice, instead recommending consultation with a healthcare professional.

Visuals: Supported by an AI-generated illustration of a friendly AI assistant.

Informative Blog Section:

Purpose: Designed to host articles, research updates, patient stories, and expert opinions related to HCV.

Layout: Features a card-based design for blog post previews.

Visuals: Each blog card includes an AI-generated illustration relevant to its topic.

Dynamic Image Generation:

A core feature of the landing page is the use of Google's Imagen API (imagen-3.0-generate-002) to dynamically create unique and relevant illustrations for each section, enhancing visual appeal and thematic consistency.

Professional Footer:

Includes standard links (Company, Resources, Contact), copyright information, and a reiteration of the medical disclaimer.

Technology Stack (as evident from the landing page code):

Frontend Framework: React.js

UI Library: Material-UI (MUI) with extensive custom theming for a unique look and feel.

Styling:

MUI's styled utility (similar to styled-components).

CSS keyframe animations for subtle visual effects (fade-ins, slide-ins).

AI Integration:

Text Generation: Google Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash) for the HcvInfoBot.

Image Generation: Google Imagen API (imagen-3.0-generate-002) for section visuals.

Responsive Design: Ensures usability across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Design Philosophy & User Experience:

Modern & Trustworthy: Aims for a clean, professional, and technologically advanced aesthetic to build user trust.

Informative & Empowering: Provides clear, accessible information about HCV.

Engaging: Uses dynamic visuals and interactive elements (like the AI bot) to keep users engaged.

User-Centric: Smooth navigation, clear calls-to-action, and responsive layout prioritize the user experience.

Potential Future Enhancements (beyond the current landing page):

Actual ML Model Integration: Developing and integrating the core machine learning model for HCV stage detection based on user-inputted (anonymized) blood test data. This would require significant backend development, data security measures, and adherence to medical data regulations.

User Accounts & Profiles: For saving results (if the diagnostic tool is implemented), tracking information, or personalized content.

Secure Data Handling: Implementing robust security for any patient data, if collected.

Expanded Blog Functionality: Full content management system for the blog.

Healthcare Professional Portal: A separate section or login for medical professionals with more detailed information or tools.

Localization: Translating the content into multiple languages.

This project, HCVDetect, presents a strong foundation for a valuable health information platform, with the AI-powered HcvInfoBot being a notable interactive feature already implemented on the landing page.
