### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We will work with you on coordinated disclosure timing

### What to Expect

- We will respond to your report as quickly as possible
- We will keep you informed of our progress toward resolving the issue
- We may ask for additional information or guidance
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Measures

### Current Security Implementations

#### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication with configurable expiration

- **API Versioning**: Versioned APIs for backward compatibility

#### Data Protection

- **Database Security**: Encrypted connections and parameterized queries
- **Data Sanitization**: Input/output sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Secure storage of API keys and secrets
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption at rest and in transit

#### Infrastructure Security

- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate development, staging, and production environments
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information

### Security Headers Implemented

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains

```

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Code Security

- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Follow secure coding guidelines for Django and React
- Regular security code reviews

#### API Development

- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Implement proper authentication for all endpoints
- Validate request data with serializers
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints

#### Database Security

- Use environment variables for database credentials
- Enable database connection encryption
- Implement proper database user permissions
- Regular database security audits
- Backup encryption and secure storage

### For Users

#### Account Security

- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Log out from shared computers
- Report suspicious activities immediately
- Keep browser and applications updated

#### Data Privacy

- Review privacy settings regularly
- Understand what data is collected and how it's used
- Use secure networks for accessing sensitive information
- Be cautious with sharing personal health information

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. We request that:

1. **Give us reasonable time** to fix the issue before public disclosure
2. **Do not access or modify data** that doesn't belong to you
3. **Do not perform tests** that could harm our systems or users
4. **Do not use social engineering** against our employees or contractors

### Scope

This security policy applies to:

- HepatoCAI web application (frontend and backend)
- API endpoints and services
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Data storage and processing systems

### Out of Scope

The following are generally outside our scope:

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Attacks requiring physical access to user devices
- Denial of service attacks
- Issues in third-party services we use (report to the respective vendors)

## Security Incident Response

### In Case of a Security Breach

If we discover or are notified of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response** (0-4 hours)

   - Assess and contain the incident
   - Notify key stakeholders
   - Begin investigation

2. **Short-term Response** (4-24 hours)

   - Implement fixes or workarounds
   - Monitor for additional threats
   - Prepare communication plan

3. **Long-term Response** (1-7 days)
   - Conduct thorough investigation
   - Implement permanent fixes
   - Review and update security measures
   - Notify affected users if necessary

### Communication

- We will communicate security incidents transparently
- Users will be notified of any breaches affecting their data
- Post-incident reports will be published when appropriate

## Security Contacts

- **Security Email**: security@hepatocai.com
- **General Support**: support@hepatocai.com
- **Emergency Contact**: Available 24/7 for critical security issues

## Security Tools and Resources

### Automated Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular automated scans for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static Code Analysis**: Automated code security analysis
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring for suspicious activities
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular third-party security assessments
