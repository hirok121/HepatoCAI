# Production Deployment Checklist for HepatoCAI Frontend

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Environment variables configured in `.env`
- [x] Production build configuration optimized
- [x] Code splitting implemented for optimal loading
- [x] Build process verified and working
- [x] Asset optimization enabled
- [x] Security headers configuration ready
- [x] Performance optimizations implemented

## üîß Required Before Deployment

### 1. Update Production URLs (CRITICAL)

Update these environment variables in `.env` with your actual production URLs:

```bash
# API Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-domain.com/api/v1
VITE_API_AUTH_URL=https://your-api-domain.com/auth
VITE_API_UPLOAD_URL=https://your-api-domain.com/upload

# Authentication
VITE_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
VITE_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
VITE_AUTH_MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=your-microsoft-client-id

# Application
VITE_APP_BASE_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

### 2. Security Configuration

- [ ] Set up HTTPS certificate for your domain
- [ ] Configure CORS settings on your backend
- [ ] Verify CSP (Content Security Policy) settings
- [ ] Set up proper security headers on your web server

### 3. Backend Configuration

- [ ] Ensure Django backend is configured for production
- [ ] Update ALLOWED_HOSTS in Django settings
- [ ] Configure database for production
- [ ] Set up proper authentication endpoints

### 4. DNS & Domain Setup

- [ ] Point your domain to the server hosting the frontend
- [ ] Configure subdomain for API if needed
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates

## üì¶ Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Static File Hosting (Recommended)

1. Upload contents of `dist/` folder to your web hosting service
2. Configure the hosting service to serve `index.html` for all routes (SPA routing)
3. Update environment variables for production URLs
4. Test the deployment

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

1. Use the provided Dockerfile to build a container
2. Deploy to your container orchestration platform
3. Configure environment variables in your deployment

### Option 3: Traditional Web Server

1. Copy `dist/` contents to your web server's document root
2. Configure server (Apache/Nginx) for SPA routing
3. Set up SSL and security headers

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

- [ ] Test login functionality with production OAuth
- [ ] Verify API calls work with production backend
- [ ] Test file upload functionality
- [ ] Check responsive design on various devices
- [ ] Validate performance metrics
- [ ] Test error handling and fallbacks

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

- [ ] Set up error monitoring (if enabled)
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline for future updates

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API URLs are accessible
3. Check CORS configuration
4. Validate OAuth client IDs
5. Ensure backend is running and accessible
